1. Acoustic properties of all products presented are confirmed by tests carried out by notified testing entities. 
<br />
2. In the event no type of space bar used in the glass pane design is defined, parameters apply to all types of space bars. 
<br />
3. Spaces between panes in all tested insulated units are filled with argon. Parameters are valid also for insulated units filled with krypton.
<br />
4. Parameters remain valid for all glass panes made of flat sodium-calcareous-siliceous glass manufactured using the float method. 
<br />
5. Values STC and OITC shall also be confirmed for glass panes manufactured with following design modifications:
<br />
- expansion of spaces between panes 
<br />
- increasing the quantity of film in laminated panes
<br />
- application of enamel or print on pane surface - tempering, thermal strengthening, Heat Soaking 
<br />
6. Specified parameters are not applicable to panes made of ornamental glass. 
<br />
7. The following symbols are used: 
<br />
X/Y/X; X/Y/X/Y/X –characteristics of one- or two-chamber insulated units, where ""X""  means the thickness of consecutive component panes, and ""Y"" the width of gas-filled spaces between panes. Thickness values are expressed in millimetres. 
(Lami. XX.Z) – Lami. laminar pane, comprising two monolithic panes, thickness 
<br />
""X"" expressed in millimetres, separated with
<br />
""Z"" layers of film. Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr) – gas filling spaces between panes 
<br />
Float – Type of individual glass pane used"
